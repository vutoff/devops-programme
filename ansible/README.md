# Configuration Management with Ansible

Create an Ansible playbook that build, push and then run the Docker image for the Python
application. Let your playbook has the following variables:

* `image_name` - contains the name of your image without the tag, i.e. `vutoff/python-app`
* `image_tag` - contains the tag you tagged your image with, i.e. `v0.2`
* `listen_port` - contains the listening port you're binding your app to.

Make sure that you set environment variable `PORT` when you define your container
in the Ansible playbook that takes its value from `listen_port` variable.

Use Ansible modules. Do not shell out.

## Requirements

* Make sure you have Python installed. Any version above 3.8 would suffice.
* The `requirements.txt` file in this directory contains the required Ansible version. Run

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Make sure that Docker is running on your local machine.

## Mind the following

* If you're running Docker Desktop, mind the location of the `docker.sock` file. The location of the socket file is
  * Docker Desktop - `${HOME}/.docker/run/docker.sock`

* If you're using one of the above, when you write your Ansible playbook you
must specify the path to the docker socket with the parameter `docker_host`,
i.e. `docker_host: "unix://{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.rd/docker.sock"`.
