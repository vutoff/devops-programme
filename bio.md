## Professional Background

I’m an IT professional with around 4.5 years of experience across technical support and Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM engineering roles.  
Over the years, I’ve developed strong troubleshooting, collaboration, and problem-solving skills while working with cloud technologies such as Azure and the Power Platform.

Apart from my full-time position as a Junior DevOps engineer, I am currently upskilling through Telerik Academy’s DevOps Upskill program. I’m looking to gain hands-on experience with CI/CD, git and GitOps, IaC and learn about DevOps-oriented SDLC.
I’ve also begun working with professionally HashiCorp Vault Enterprise, expanding my focus on secure secrets management and operations. 

My current goal is to grow into a Regular DevOps Engineer role by the end of 2026, with a long-term plan to progress toward senior DevOps positions by 2028.
