# Simple Flask Application

This is a basic Flask application that demonstrates setting up a route and returning a response.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed.
Flask package installed: pip install Flask
Running the application:

Save the code as app.py.
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing app.py.
Run the application: python app.py
This will start the Flask development server, typically accessible at localhost port 5000 by default.

Explanation:

The app.py file initializes a Flask application instance using Flask(__name__).
The @app.route("/") decorator defines a route handler for the root path (/).
The hello_world() function is the view function associated with the root route. It returns a simple "Hello, World!" message.
The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures the application code only runs when executed directly (not imported as a module).
Inside this block, app.run() starts the development server. It listens on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and uses the port
specified by the environment variable PORT (defaulting to 5000).

Deployment:

For production deployment, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn.

Further Development:

This application serves as a basic example. You can explore Flask's rich features to build more complex web applications:

Define additional routes for different functionalities.
Use templates for dynamic content generation.
Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for user interaction.
Integrate with databases for persistent data storage.
By building upon this foundation, you can create robust and scalable web applications using Flask.
